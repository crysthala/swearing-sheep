# swearing-sheep
A resource pack that replaces sheep beeeeeh sounds with swearing. Inspired by light-blue-glazed-terracotta on Tumblr.

## Installation Instructions
Click the "Clone or Download" button on this page.
Select "Download ZIP" and save the file somewhere on your computer.
Because of how GitHub packages the files, Minecraft will be unable to recognize the resource pack at first. The easiest way to fix this is simply to open the .zip file and extract the swearing-sheep-master folder directly to your resource packs directory.
Don't forget to enable the resource pack in the options menu! Have fun!
